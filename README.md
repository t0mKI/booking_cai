# Conversational AI for car booking


To support real-world customers with the process of online car booking a conversational artificial intelligence has been developed in this project. Thereby, several Design Thinking methods have been applied in the design stage:

- Empathy-Maps
- Personas
- As-is-Scenario
- Understanding
- Big Ideas
- Core Intents

Building on this foundation, the key functionalities have been implemented in a state-of-the-art dialogue system. Among others, the price is calculated dynamically with respect to the user input and emails are sent automatically to  customer support. Both features are realized by a webhook and can be quickly tested by the test modules.
